    - Step to update:
        1) rename the following settings:
            DOCUMENTS_FILESYSTEM_FILESERVING_ENABLE
            DOCUMENTS_FILESYSTEM_FILESERVING_PATH
            DOCUMENTS_FILESYSTEM_SLUGIFY_PATHS
            DOCUMENTS_FILESYSTEM_MAX_RENAME_COUNT
        to:    
            FILESYSTEM_FILESERVING_ENABLE
            FILESYSTEM_FILESERVING_PATH
            FILESYSTEM_SLUGIFY_PATHS
            FILESYSTEM_MAX_RENAME_COUNT
        
        2) Do a ./manage.py syncdb
        3) Execute 'Recreate index links' locate in the tools menu
        4) Wait a few minutes
        
        Some warnings may be returned, but these are not fatal as they might 
        be related to missing metadata in some documents.
